## Overview

My first ever attempt at anything like this before. Great way to get back into the swing of things by doing!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & SASS
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I didn't manage to get the hover affect on the NFT logo exactly correct. Given more time im sure a solution would have come up with either tinkering and / or google.

Other than improving my CSS skills and understanding of flexbox without trial and erroring much, the skills aren't very difficult anymore.
